# How do I approach designing software?
I Start by understanding the problem you're solving. Then, I gather requirements from stakeholders to ensure the software meets their needs.
# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you craft? 
Learning to incorporate user feedback and iterate based on testing has enhanced my focus on usability.
# What design process did you follow for your project work? 
I used the Agile methodology. I employed iterative cycles with regular feedback loops, allowing for adjustments based on testing and user input.
# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? 
Documentation purposes. It will help me maintain thorough documentation to make onboarding and collaboration easier in future projects.
# How do I approach developing programs? 
First I will do research and planning before I try to decompose the problem into smaller, manageable tasks. This helps organize work and set milestones.
# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? 
I focused on optimizing rendering techniques to enhance performance, such as using vertex buffers.
# How did iteration factor into your development? 
Each iteration included testing phases, allowing for immediate identification and resolution of issues.
# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? 
Incorporating industry's standard. I learned to adopt coding standards and best practices more rigorously, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. 
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
It has helped me increase my critical thinking skills. 
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
Understanding graphics principles encourages innovative solutions to complex problems, which is beneficial in any tech-related career.
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? 
Knowledge of graphics can enhance my capabilities in animation, which makes me versatile in the job market.
